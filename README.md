# 🛣️ Urban Road Patterns & Traffic Congestion in Indonesia

This project explores how **road lane configurations and directional patterns** impact traffic congestion in major Indonesian cities. By analyzing road orientations and congestion indexes, the project uncovers how city layout influences the flow of traffic — offering insight into better urban traffic management.

## 📌 Background

Traffic congestion is a recurring issue in many large Indonesian cities such as Jakarta, Bandung, and Medan. However, not all cities experience it at the same intensity. One contributing factor is the **structure and direction of their road networks**.

Through spatial analysis and traffic data, this project investigates:

- How road layouts (grid, radial, random) affect traffic distribution  
- The impact of directional clustering on congestion points  
- The relationship between lane capacity and traffic flow

## 🗂️ Dataset & Sources

- 📍 Road direction data from 10 major cities in Indonesia  
- 🚦 Congestion index sourced from [TomTom Traffic Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bwandowando/tomtom-traffic-data-55-countries-387-cities)  
- 🌐 Geographic coordinates from [latlong.net](https://www.latlong.net/)

Cities analyzed include: Jakarta, Bandung, Surabaya, Semarang, Medan, Malang, Denpasar, Yogyakarta, Padang, and Pontianak.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, GeoPandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook  
- QGIS / GeoPandas for geospatial mapping  
- Optional: Tableau or Plotly for interactive visualization  

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- City-wise **road direction clusters**  
- **Intersection density maps**  
- Comparative analysis of congestion by road layout (e.g., grid vs radial)

🧩 Sample insights:

- **Radial patterns** (e.g., Yogyakarta) lead to congestion at city centers.  
- **Grid systems** (e.g., Semarang, Jakarta) offer alternatives but create high-density intersections.  
- **Random layouts** (e.g., Padang) provide flexibility but unpredictable flow.

## 🧠 Insights

While road design is not the only factor influencing traffic, it plays a crucial role. Some strategies highlighted include:

- 🔧 Road engineering (dedicated lanes, optimized intersections)  
- 🚦 Smart traffic systems (adaptive traffic lights, real-time routing)  
- 🚲 Promotion of sustainable mobility (bike lanes, walkability, public transit)

---

## ✅ Conclusion

> Road pattern optimization — especially when supported by modern technology and urban planning — can significantly reduce congestion and improve safety for all road users.
